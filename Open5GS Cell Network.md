## Open5gs

![[Pasted image 20250912111345.png]]

TUN/TAP (Kernel virtual network devices) - supported entire by software. TUN(nel) simulates a network layer device that carries IP packets.

- EPC (Evolved packet core) - handles the communication between RANs and mobile networks and etc. Powers 4G LTE networks.
- 5G core powers 5G networks of course.

AMF (Authentication management field) is on the connecting client question mark.

APN (Access point name) must match on phone and core?? (anyways what is core)

5G NSA (Non-standalone)

IMSI (International mobile subscriber identity) - is unique to each SIM card.

PLMN (Public landline mobile network) - is a combination of wireless communication services offered by a specific operator in a specific country.

Notes: 

uhd building from source is also being weird. so rn we use the 4.9.0 release. **but i believe the 4.0.0 or 3.1.5. are the ones compatible with srsran** (rn with 4.9.0 there's an error when building srsran but it can be fixed by adding a line which is sketchy ig) -- so def switch back to that later if curr setup works. 

open5gs build from source is buggy. there is a open5gs vonr error that idk where it's from. trying with package (did not config logging, but that'll only affect journalctl prints ig so it's not a big deal; also webui is facing some troubles.)

because srsran_proj does not have a release, i have to remove ppa for that before running the open5gs web page. 

ref to the medium article 

adding subscriber rn. 

building a open5gs core rn. there're many config files in /etc/open5gs/ that can be referred to ig.

## USRP and UHD

```
$ sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host
```

Control plane - manages routing tables and many things.

TUN device - virtual network devices completely supported by software. Simulates network interface. 

HSS - generates SIM authentication and holds subscriber profiles
SGWC and PGWC - control plans

EPC - Evolved Packet Core

MCC and MNC - The Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC) areÂ **unique identifiers of countries and mobile networks across the world**

Execute all NFs with: (not sure what NF means at all)
```
./build/tests/app/5gc
```

# srsRAN

It supports building private customizable 5G networks. 

CU/DU in 5g - CU (Centralized Unit) supports upper level protocols while DU (Distributed Unit) supports lower layer ones.

Software-defined radio (SDR) - computer software emulates hardware functionalities that can do signal processing. 

Radio communication systems - radio waves are electromagnetic wave (freq. 3 Hz to 300 GHz) generated by transmitters and radiated by antennas.

Radio access network (RAN) - it's a mobile device network that connects to end-users. 
- Virtualized RAN (vRAN) - no longer requires proprietary hardware to run but instead runs on any general server.
- Open RAN (O-RAN) - Container-based and cloud-native implementation of vRAN.
