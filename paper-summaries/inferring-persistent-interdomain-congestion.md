System modules:
==[_bdrmap_](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/bdrmap_dataset/)== tracks what target ASes belongs to what organizations **and** how/if they are reachable.
- _[CAIDA](https://www.caida.org/)(Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis)_ is in San Diego. 
- [Whois](https://www.whois.com/whois/) is a database that supports lookups of domain name ownership and such. 
==_TSLP_==: (time-series latency probing) now that we have inferred the border routers' IP address, we say there might be inter-domain congestion between two, if near-link latency did not change while far-link latency increases.
==_Packet loss module_==: probes the border router way more frequent so it sees more accurate loss rate.
_==Throughput module==_: use NDT. Paths from VPs have to go through NDT servers to use their tools. 
_AS (Autonomous System)_ each has an ASN (Autonomous System Number) is unique. 
_Sibling ASes_ exists as autonomous systems but they belong to the same overarching organization.
_Network Diagnostic Tool_ (NDT) reports the upload/download speed and latency stats. It measures a connection's _Bulk Transport Capacity_ (BTC). 
- is a measure of a network's ability to transfer significant quantities of data with a single congestion-aware transport connection
A _video manifest file_ is a piece of metadata that docs how to fetch and play the media content. 
- [bitrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/5i1agx/what_is_bitrate_and_is_it_better_higher_or_lower/) (bps) is the number of bits processed in order to stream a media for one second.
