## Problem Description

I've been trying to set up a gNB with srsRAN, Open5GS, and a X410 USRP device. However, the network does not show up in my UE's list of networks. I'm think that the problem could be in the configuration files. I'm also not sure if the way I connect the antenna could cause the problem.

## Setup Details

Core Platform: Open5GS 
RF device: USRP X410mn (connected via ethernet cable with ip address set to `192.168.20.2`)
UHD version: 4.8.0
OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
UE: Nothing phone 2
