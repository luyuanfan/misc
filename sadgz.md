## Problem Description

I've been trying to set up a gNB with srsRAN, Open5GS, and a X410 USRP device. However, the network does not show up in my UE's list of networks. I'm not sure if the problem could be in the configuration files. 

## Setup Details

Core Platform: Open5GS
RF device: USRP X410
UHD version: 4.8.0
OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
UE: Nothing phone 2

## Open5GS and gNB Configs
